# Internal Work Package

The internal_work package is a Python package created for internal use by Matt Hanauer. It contains three functions that aid in machine learning tasks, including hyperparameter tuning using Bayesian optimization with stacked gradient boosting regressors, starting an experiment with versioned data using MLflow, and encoding categorical data using one-hot encoding.
